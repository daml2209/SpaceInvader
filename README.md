# Space Invaders - Basic Version

The following project aimed to put into practice most of the knowledge acquired throughout my studies in pythons in order to reinforce them through practical execution

### Prerequisites

In order to execute the game it will necesary to have **Python** installed as the next libraries:
 * pygame
 * math
 * random
 * mixer from the pygame library
 
### Scope

This project was made using the basic python code. Throughout it we will see that this was written with the use of functions and not objects in order to understand the most basic pygame structure.

For this reason, the code has certain limitations that will be resolved in the next project **(SpaceInvaders_POO)**, which will consist on applying everything learned in this project to make an improved version using **object-oriented programming**.
